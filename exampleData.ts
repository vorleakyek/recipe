Put a 16\"-18\" paella pan on grill grate; heat 1\/2 cup olive oil. Add 3\/4 lb.

Rotate pan every 2-3 minutes to cook evenly.\nArrange 3 1-1 1\/4-pound lobsters, halved lengthwise, claws cracked, over the rice.

Cook until the rice is almost tender and the lobster is cooked through, about 10 more minutes.\nScatter 2 cups shelled peas or frozen peas, thawed, on top. (If the liquid evaporates before the rice is tender, add more hot stock.) Cook without stirring, allowing rice to absorb all of the liquid, so that a crust (the socarrat) develops on the bottom and the edges begin to dry out and get crusty, 5-10 minutes, for a total cooking time of about 40 minutes.\nRemove pan from grill. Cover with large clean kitchen towels and let rest for 5 minutes.
